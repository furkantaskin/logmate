# Logmate

Logmate is a browser extension to help automatic logins to the saved panels. It gets the list of active urls through the API powered by FastAPI. 

Users can add their desired URLs and information through the extension.

> **Warning**
> This project is using it's own API. For those who want to use for their own panels should keep their data on their server. This package neither collect nor store any data for other users.


## Roadmap

- HashiCorp Vault authentication (secrets management)
- Best practicing TypeScript for better performance
- OAuth for API connection
- Editing information and duplicate info checker
- Autofill by reading the URL and finding the best match
